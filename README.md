# exoniannewsletter

###How it works
People will, on theexonian.com, enter their email. It will be sent to the database at emailexonian.firebaseio.com. They can unsubsciber at unsubscribe.html. The newsletter it made up of outer.html (header/footer), and inner.html (the formatting for each article title/article/link). multiple inner.html are inserted into one outer.html.

###TODO today
####1. 
Insert subscribe.html into the footer of theexonian.com
####2. 
Make unsubscribe.html look nicer, and get its own url on theexonian.com/asdfasdfadsf
####3.
Make the footer of outer.html for the newsletter look nicer
